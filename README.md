A high-performance, modern 3D Protein Structure Viewer built for speed and usability. Visualize PDB structures with advanced rendering, custom coloring, and molecular analysis tools directly in your browser.

## ✨ Features

- **📂 Dual Loading Modes**: Instantly fetch structures from the **RCSB PDB** by ID or upload your own `.pdb` / `.cif` files locally.
- **🎨 Rich Representations**: Switch between **Cartoon**, **Ball & Stick**, **Spacefill**, **Licorice**, **Surface**, and **Backbone** views.
- **🌈 Advanced Coloring**: Color by **Chain ID**, **Element**, **Residue**, **Secondary Structure**, **Hydrophobicity**, or define **Custom Color Rules**.
- **📏 Molecular Analysis**:
  - **Distance Measurement**: Click any two atoms to measure the distance in Angstroms (Å) with visual indicators.
  - **Ligand Focus**: Automatically detect and zoom into ligand binding sites.
  - **Sequence Viewer**: Interactive protein sequence bar—hover to identify residues, click to highlight them in 3D.
- **💡 Visual Enhancements**:
  - **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between a sleek dark interface and a clean light theme.
  - **Surface Overlay**: Toggle transparent molecular surfaces.
  - **High-Res Export**: Capture publication-quality renders (PNG) at 3x resolution.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Fully responsive UI with a collapsible sidebar for seamless use on tablets and desktops.
